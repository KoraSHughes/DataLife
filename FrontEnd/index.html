				<p class="heading-2">What is the matching algorithm?</p>
				<p class="body">
					At the core of the admission process is the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm. This procedure is designed to
					assign students to schools in a way that respects both the students' preferences and the ordering of students
					compiled by each school.
				</p>
				<p class="body">
					At the end of the algorithm, all assignments are ensured to be stable: this means that,
					among the schools that would offer them a seat, each student will be admitted to the one they ranked the highest
					in their preference list. At the same time, this also means that schools will accept the students they ranked the
					highest.

				<p class="heading-3">Tentative matching</p>
				<p class="body">
					The key to the process is using tentative matches. As the algorithm progresses, each school holds its seats for
					the best-ranked students who requested to be admitted up to that point; when a student ranked higher than the
					current seat holders makes a request, they will be given a seat at the expense of the lowest-ranked student who
					was matched previously.
				</p>
				<p class="body">
					This is a critical feature of the Gale-Shapley algorithm, as it guarantees that the
					outcome will always be the same, regardless of the order in which the students are considered. This mechanism
					encourages students to place their truly preferred schools at the top of their rankings: given the set of
					schools that would accept a student, the student will always be matched with the one they ranked the highest.

				<p class="heading-3">List length limitation</p>
				<p class="body">
					To carry out the matching, the algorithm described above requires students to provide a ranking of all schools
					in NYC, and schools to provide a ranking of all applying students.
				</p>
				<p class="body">
					While this is feasible for schools, it is
					unreasonable to expect the students and their families to rank hundreds of schools: for this reason, the student
					preference list is limited to a maximum of 12 schools. Unfortunately, applying this limit comes at a cost: not
					all students will be able to find a seat within their top 12 choices, and those who do not are said to be
					unmatched.

				<p class="body">
					After the matching process, the Department of Education assigns each unmatched student to a school
					picked at random from those that still have available seats, ensuring all applying students are admitted to a
					school.
				</p>
				<p class="body">
					The randomness in the assignment of schools to unmatched students can result in unfortunate matchings,
					such as students being admitted to schools that do not specialize in their subjects of interest, or schools that
					are very distant from their residence. To avert this possibility, then, it is essential that students give
					thought to the preference list, maximizing their chances of getting accepted in one of their express choices.

								The lottery number's purpose is tie-breaking: regardless of the specific

							<p class="body">
								One critical feature of the lottery number is the fact that, once it is assigned to a student, it is unique:

							<p class="heading-3">In a nutshell</p>
							<p class="body">
								When evaluating the lottery number, the most important digits to examine are the first six: the lower they
								are, the better.
							</p>
							<p class="body">
								Remember that the digits are ordered 0-9, then A-F: a lottery number starting with 0 is very good, one

							This comparison is repeated until two digits in the same position are found to be different: this is guaranteed
