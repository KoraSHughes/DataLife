				<p class="heading-2">What is the matching algorithm?</p>
				<p class="body">
					At the core of the admission process is the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm. This procedure is designed to
					assign students to schools in a way that respects both the students' preferences and the ordering of students
					compiled by each school. At the end of the algorithm, all assignments are ensured to be stable: this means that,
					among the schools that would offer them a seat, each student will be admitted to the one they ranked the highest
					in their preference list. At the same time, this also means that schools will accept the students they ranked the
					highest.

				<p class="heading-3">Tentative matching</p>
				<p class="body">
					The key to the process is using tentative matches. As the algorithm progresses, each school holds its seats for
					the best-ranked students who requested to be admitted up to that point; when a student ranked higher than the
					current seat holders makes a request, they will be given a seat at the expense of the lowest-ranked student who
					was matched previously. This is a critical feature of the Gale-Shapley algorithm, as it guarantees that the
					outcome will always be the same, regardless of the order in which the students are considered. This mechanism
					encourages students to place their truly preferred schools at the top of their rankings: given the set of
					schools that would accept a student, the student will always be matched with the one they ranked the highest.

				<p class="heading-3">List length limitation</p>
				<p class="body">
					To carry out the matching, the algorithm described above requires students to provide a ranking of all schools
					in NYC, and schools to provide a ranking of all applying students. While this is feasible for schools, it is
					unreasonable to expect the students and their families to rank hundreds of schools: for this reason, the student
					preference list is limited to a maximum of 12 schools. Unfortunately, applying this limit comes at a cost: not
					all students will be able to find a seat within their top 12 choices, and those who do not are said to be
					unmatched.
				</p>
				<p class="heading-3">Unmatching</p>
				<p class="body">
					After the matching process, the Department of Education assigns each unmatched student to a school
					picked at random from those that still have available seats, ensuring all applying students are admitted to a
					school. The randomness in the assignment of schools to unmatched students can result in unfortunate matchings,
					such as students being admitted to schools that do not specialize in their subjects of interest, or schools that
					are very distant from their residence. To avert this possibility, then, it is essential that students give
					thought to the preference list, maximizing their chances of getting accepted in one of their express choices.

				<p class="heading-2">Lottery number</p>
				<p class="subtitle">
					One of the most confusing aspects of the admission process is the lottery number. This number is assigned
					randomly to each student by the Department of Education and plays an important role in the outcome of the
					matching algorithm.
				</p>
				<p class="heading-3">What does it do?</p>
				<p class="body">
					The lottery number's purpose is tie-breaking: regardless of the specific
					<a href="policies.html">ranking policy</a>
					adopted by each school, the sheer size of the applicant pool means there likely will be multiple students with
					the same score. In such a case, the order of the tied students is decided thanks to the lottery number. For many
					schools, a good lottery number might be the key factor in getting accepted: it is hard to overstate the
					significance of this element of the admission process.
				</p>
				<p class="body">
					One critical feature of the lottery number is the fact that, once it is assigned to a
					student, it is unique: it is the same for all schools and it will be used to break any ties that affect the
					student. As a result, the way the
					<a href="preferences.html">preference list</a>
					is compiled should heavily take into account the assigned lottery number, as it can sway the chances of matching
					in a significant way.

				<p class="heading-3">Evaluating your lottery number</p>
				<p class="body">
					By now, the relevance of the lottery number should be well established. You might notice, however, that this
					number does not necessarily look like a number: this is because it is encoded in hexadecimal code, meaning it
					will include the digits 0-9 as well as the letters A-F. Nonetheless, the way these numbers are compared is very
					straightforward.
				</p>
				<p class="body">
					Starting from the first digit to the left, lower digits will be ranked ahead of higher digits,
					and if the specific digits being compared are the same, then the next position in the lottery numbers is
					examined. This comparison is repeated until two digits are found that are different (this is guaranteed to
					happen, as no two students can have the same lottery number); in practice, the comparison typically never goes
					further than the 6th digit out of 32. To summarize: when evaluating the lottery number, the most important
					digits to examine are the first six, and the lower they are, the better. Remember that the digits are ordered
					0-9, then A-F: a lottery number starting with 0 is very good, one starting with 5 is pretty good, but one
					starting with E is very bad.
