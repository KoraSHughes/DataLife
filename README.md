# Description:
Project title: A nutritional label for NYC high-school admissions: Explaining ranking and matching to middle school students
Project description:
The goal of this project is to develop an interactive simulation of two-sided matching [1], grounded in a specific use case – high-school admissions in New York City [2-4].  The simulation will be accompanied by an adaptive “nutritional label” [5,6] that explains results of the simulation, and highlights changes when simulation parameters change, to applicants – middle-school students and their families.

The project will be supervised by Prof. Julia Stoyanovich, Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, Associate Professor of Data Science, and Director of the Center for Responsible AI at New York University and Prof. Amélie Marian, Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. 

The project will be carried out in partnership with the New York Hall of Science (NYSCI), an educational institution in Queens, NY that described itself as “a hub for researchers, developers, and producers in education, to create and study new ways of delivering equitable learning opportunities that are anchored in our Design Make Play approach to learning and STEM engagement.”  NYSCI develops and hosts full-scale science exhibits as well as hands-on smaller-scale interactive activities that aim to teach visitors - primarily children of different ages - about a range of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) topics.

Project participants – graduate students in data science and design from NYU and Politecnico di Milano – will collaboratively implement the Gale-Shapley Stable Marriage matching algorithm.  They will implement a graphical user interface that allows applicants – middle-school students and their families – to run the simulation according to specified parameters and understand the results.  To make the user interface understandable to applicants and their families, the team will engage in collaborative design and evaluation activities with the “customer” – NYSCI staff with experience in educating middle-school students and, if appropriate IRB permissions are received on time - with a sample of middle-school students who attend NYSCI.
